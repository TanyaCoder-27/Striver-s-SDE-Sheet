# 1.6. Stock Buy And Sell

## Implementing Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock, a classic Greedy Algorithm problem. This solution efficiently finds the maximum profit you can achieve by buying and selling once in O(n) time and O(1) space. Let’s break it down step by step, create a memorization trick, and explain why it works.

### 🔹 Explanation & Logic
The goal is to determine the maximum profit from a list of stock prices where: 1️⃣ You can buy only once.
2️⃣ You can sell only once.
3️⃣ You must buy before selling.
### 🚀 Step-by-Step Execution
- Initialize variables:
- max_profit = 0 → Stores the highest profit encountered so far.
- min_ele = prices[0] → Tracks the minimum price seen so far.
- profit = 0 → Tracks potential profit at each step.
- Iterate over prices starting from day 1 (i = 1)
- Calculate profit:
profit = prices[i] - min_ele
- Checks how much profit can be made if sold today.
- Update max_profit with the highest profit so far:
max_profit = Math.max(max_profit, profit)
- Update min_ele to track the lowest price:
min_ele = Math.min(min_ele, prices[i])
- This ensures we're always buying at the lowest price before selling.
- Return max_profit after processing all days.

### 🧠 Memorization Trick
Use "Track Min → Compute Profit → Update Max" to remember the sorting order!
🔹 Track Min (min_ele) → Keep track of the lowest price encountered so far.
🔹 Compute Profit (prices[i] - min_ele) → Check today's possible profit.
🔹 Update Max (max_profit) → Keep track of the best profit seen.
💡 Think of it like shopping for stocks:
- Track Min → Find the lowest possible price to buy.
- Compute Profit → See how much you’d gain if you sell now.
- Update Max → Keep track of the best deal possible.

### 📌 Why This Works?
✅ Single-pass O(n) traversal → No nested loops.
✅ No extra space O(1) → We only use variables.
✅ Handles edge cases efficiently (only one price, no profit case).

### 💡 Example Walkthrough
Input:
prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Processing:
min_ele = 7, max_profit = 0
Day 1: Price = 1 → min_ele = 1
Day 2: Price = 5 → profit = 5 - 1 = 4 → max_profit = 4
Day 3: Price = 3 → profit = 3 - 1 = 2 → (max_profit stays 4)
Day 4: Price = 6 → profit = 6 - 1 = 5 → max_profit = 5
Day 5: Price = 4 → profit = 4 - 1 = 3 → (max_profit stays 5)
Final max_profit = 5
✅ Correct Answer: 5 (Buy at 1, Sell at 6)

```
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int max_profit =0;
        int min_ele = prices[0];
        int profit =0;
        for(int i=1;i<prices.length;i++){
            profit = prices[i] - min_ele;

            max_profit = Math.max(max_profit,profit);
            min_ele = Math.min(min_ele,prices[i]);
        }
        return max_profit;
    }
}


```

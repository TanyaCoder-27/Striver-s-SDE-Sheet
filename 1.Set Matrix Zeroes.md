# 1.Set Matrix Zeroes

## General Logic:
The goal is to set entire rows and columns to zero if any element in the matrix is zero. A naive approach would be to use extra space and keep track of which rows and columns need to be zeroed out. However, this solution uses the first row and column as markers, reducing space complexity to O(1).
Here’s the step-by-step logic:
1.	Determine if the first row and first column contain zeroes
o	We check separately for the first row and first column, since we will use them later as markers.
2.	Mark the rows and columns that should be zeroed out using the first row and column
o	Instead of creating extra arrays to track which rows/columns need to be zeroed, we use the first row and first column themselves as indicators.
o	If matrix[i][j] == 0, set matrix[i][0] = 0 and matrix[0][j] = 0.
3.	Set the marked rows and columns to zero
o	Iterate through the matrix and, for each row that has a zero in the first column, update all its columns to zero.
o	Similarly, for each column that has a zero in the first row, update all its rows to zero.
4.	Set the first row and first column to zero if needed
•	If the first row originally had a zero, make the entire first row zero.
•	If the first column originally had a zero, make the entire first column zero.

## Why are we doing it this way?
Instead of using extra memory for a separate tracking array, we optimize space complexity by cleverly using the first row and column as markers. This avoids an O(m × n) space complexity and keeps it to O(1).
How to Remember the Logic?
•	Step 1: Check if the first row/column has zeros separately.
•	Step 2: Use the first row & column as markers instead of extra space.
•	Step 3: Update the matrix based on the markers.
•	Step 4: Finally, zero out the first row and column if needed.
You can also think of it as "Mark first row & column, use them, then restore them"—this structure helps in memorization!

## Note: 
At the beginning of the solution, we separately check whether the first row or first column originally contained any zeroes. This is because later on, we're using the first row and column as markers, which means their values might get changed during processing. However, we still need to correctly update them at the end if they initially had a zero.

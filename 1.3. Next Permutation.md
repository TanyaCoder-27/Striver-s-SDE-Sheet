# 1.3. Next Permutation

## 🔍 Understanding the Logic
The goal is to find the next larger permutation of a given number sequence. If no larger permutation exists, return the smallest permutation (sorted in ascending order).
Here’s how we do it:
### Step 1: Find the "break point"
- Traverse the array from right to left.
- Find the first decreasing element (A[i] < A[i+1]).
- This break point (ind) tells us where the permutation needs to be altered.
- Why? Because everything to the right is sorted in descending order, meaning this is the place where we can swap to get a larger number.
### Step 2: Find the next larger element & swap
- Traverse the array again from right to left.
- Find the smallest element greater than A[ind].
- Swap them to ensure minimal change, making it the next greater permutation.
### Step 3: Reverse the right half
- The right side is still in descending order.
- Reversing it makes it ascending, ensuring the smallest next permutation.

## 🧠 How to Memorize the Logic
Use this easy mnemonic technique: "Find → Swap → Reverse" 1️⃣ Find the first dip (A[i] < A[i+1] from right to left).
2️⃣ Swap it with the next greater element.
3️⃣ Reverse the right portion to get the smallest next permutation.
Think of it as correcting the number just slightly rather than completely changing the order.

```
class Solution {  
    

    public void nextPermutation(int[] nums) {  
         
         //finding break point

         int ind = -1;
         int n = nums.length;
         for(int i = n-2; i>=0;i--){
            if(nums[i]< nums[i+1]){
                ind = i;
                break;
            }
         }
        // if no breakpoint found
         if(ind == -1){
            reverse(nums,0,n-1);
            return;
         }
         
            //swap the breakpoint element with the next greater element

            for(int i=n-1;i>ind;i--){
                if(nums[i] > nums[ind]){
                    int temp = nums[i];
                    nums[i] = nums[ind];
                    nums[ind] = temp;
                    break;
                }
                
            }

            //reverse the right half
            reverse(nums,ind+1,n-1);
         

    }

    private static void reverse(int[] arr, int l,int r){
        while(l<r){
            int temp = arr[l];
            arr[l] = arr[r];
            arr[r] = temp;
            l++;
            r--;
        }
    }  
}
